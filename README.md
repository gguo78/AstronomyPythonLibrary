## Self-evaluation

- Yini Mao: I contributed to this project for around 30 hours. I wrote the readme file for the API draft. I worked with Jiayi Xu on figuring out how to interact with SDSS and important variables for identifying objects. Then, we worked on developing tests and codes for data_retrieval and data_augmentation. After that, I collaborated with other team members on merging feature branches into the dev branch and creating integration tests. Finally, I created the readme file for this project, published the package, and wrote demo codes. 

- Yilin Qi: For this project, I contributed about 30 hours. I was in charge of writing the visualization module and working on the preprocessing module with Grace Guo. I also tested the visualization and preprocessing modules, and fixed errors related to individual module testing or module interactions. I also actively engaged in group meetings to make sure changes are relayed between modules. Finally, I worked on updating the API_draft on the dev branch with Grace Guo, published our module package, and wrote demo code for our Jupyter Notebook file. 

- Jiayi Xu: I contributed approximately 30 hours to the project. My responsibilities included creating a schematic_diagram to illustrate the modules and working with Yini Mao on SDSS interaction to extract features and variables. I also developed and tested the data_retrieval and data_augmentation modules, updated project documentation, worked on integration test drafting, and engaged in group meetings. Finally, I completed the README file in the dev branch, published the package, and wrote demo codes in the Python Notebook.

- Grace Guo: I contributed appropriately 30 hours to various tasks. My main responsibilities included developing the visualization and preprocessing module with Yilin Qi. We worked on developing tests and codes for visualization and preprocessing and to ensure smooth flow of the data from one module to another. Also, I actively participated in group meetings to edit and change codes for the modules for seamless coordination. Also, Yilin and I collaboratively update the API_draft on the dev branch. Finally, I published the package and wrote demo code for our Jupyter notebook file. 


- Dean Hazineh: I contributed around 30 hours. I coded the modules and tests for cross-matching, preprocessing, classification, and a first version of the data retrieval. I also set up the initial testing workflow, some integration tests, and created part of the demo.
